        <h2>Major research interests:</h2>
        <p>The development of the world salmon farming industry, with emphasis on strategy, markets and market development.Special focus on the Norwegian, Chilean and North American suppliers, and the European, American, Japanese, and Chinese markets.In depth study of the players and the power structures of the industry.</p>
        <p>As part of a new ”Porter-study ” on Norwegian competitiveness (“A Value Creating Norway”), I was responsible for one of four clusters, “Fisheries & Aquaculture”.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have been teaching in China since the late 1990’ s - initially at EricssonChinaAcademy, and at the Fudan-BI MBA program since its inception. I am course responsible for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, and have been working in this area for the past 15 years. Previously, I have been teaching management, marketing, and international business – mostly at the graduate level – around the world.</p>
        <p>I was educated at HarvardUniversityand received an A.B. cum laude in Government, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Graduate School of Business.</p>
        <p>I was dean at the Norwegian School of Management when it was merged with BI Norwegian School of Management in 1992. During the 1990s, I served two periods as dean of BI’s MBA program.</p>
        <p>In 1989-91, and 1994, I was visiting professor at University of Washington, School of Business in Seattle, and I have also been a visiting professor at Helsinki School of Business (1998), and at Babson College in Boston (2000-01). From 1992-2004 I was also a visiting professor at Universidad Gabriela Mistral in Santiago-de-Chile, and I was also an advisor to the president of that university.　 At UW, Babson, and UGM most of my teaching was at the MBA-level, but I have also taught an undergraduate course in entrepreneurship at Soros Summer School in Chisinau , Moldova.</p>
        <p>I have many years experience from industry, and have set up several new enterprises. I have also been a board member/chair of several companies, and now serve as chairman of the board at Coast Seafood AS, one of Norway’s leading exporters of seafood. At BI I have been chair of the Researchers Association (Forskerforbundet), and director of corporate relations. I resigned from my position at BI on October 31st, 2007, but will continue to teach in BI’s MBA programs. I am now a member of the Oslo City Council, and the Standing Committee on Urban Development.</p>
        <h2>Research interests</h2>
        <p>I have primarily focused on two industries – telecom and aquaculture. In 1999, I was part of the team that performed a Porter-study on Norway, being responsible for the Fisheries & Aquaculture (Seafood) cluster. However, I have spent considerably more time on case development, case teaching, and consulting, than on traditional academic research. I never got around to completing a Ph.D. program, but have nevertheless been given professorial status at UW, UGM, and Babson.</p>
        <h2>Motivation to teach in China</h2>
        <p>Since my first visits to Chinain the early 1980s, I have been fascinated by this huge and very influential country. It has been a great privilege to teach entrepreneurship in a country which such a great entrepreneurial potential, and to follow how the country has been transformed and literally changes by the hour. Our MBA students at Fudan will undoubtedly have a great impact on the further development of this great nation. It is amazing to discover how every new the student group is the best ever. That’s why I also look forward to challenge, and be challenged by new groups of Chinese MBA-students in the future.</p>
