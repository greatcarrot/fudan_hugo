        <img class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block margin-20" alt="..." width="..." height="..." src="/images/campus_3.jpg">
        <p>The home of our MBA program is at the School of Management, Fudan University in Shanghai. All but one core course are held here, as well as six of the nine electives (three courses are held overseas). As China’s first higher education institution to establish the educational system of Business Administration, the century-old Fudan University created the business discipline in as early as 1917, and later set up the School of Business in 1929. Fudan University suspended the education of management in the 1952, when new waves of restructuring hit (OMIT ‘all the’) universities and colleges nationwide. After the country started to implement reform and open-up policies, Fudan University took the lead to resume the education of management, started to enrol undergraduates for Management Science in 1977, established Department of Management Science in 1979 and restored the School of Management in 1985.</p>
        <p>In order to promote the exchanges and cooperative research with the world’s top business schools and develop more diversified global resources, the School also joined many prestigious international organisations for business education. In 2007, FDSM was admitted as a formal member of the Partnership in International Management (PIM) and later became the 173rd full member of Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) in 2009. Meanwhile, the School was awarded the EQUIS Accreditation by EFMD in 2009 and then achieved the AACSB Accreditation in 2010 within the shortest period of time in the world.</p>
