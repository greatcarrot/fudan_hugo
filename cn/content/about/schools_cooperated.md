        <h2 class="title">Fudan School of Management</h2>
        <p>Since its reestablishment in 1985, School of Management at Fudan University (FDSM) has grown along with the historic process of reform and opening-up in China. Driven by our School’s noble mission of "setting roots in China in its progress, dedicating itself to innovative research, and cultivating academic specialists, business elites and social leaders with global perspectives and local insights", all the faculty and staff at FDSM have spared no effort to not only enhance our teaching and research competences in an all-round manner but also cultivate large numbers of outstanding management talent for China’s more prosperous economic development in the future.</p>
        <p>The past 29 years of our persistent efforts have consolidated the foundation for our further development and accumulated more energy for us to reach for higher ambitions. FDSM was accredited by EQUIS and AACSB, two of the highest accreditations for business management education, respectively in 2009 and 2010 at an unprecedentedly fast pace around the world. In 2013, four programs of FDSM entered the Top 100 EMBA Programs ranked by Financial Times, making our School one of the schools with the largest amount of entries in the rankings. These honors are recognition of our School’s long-term dedication to academic research, talent cultivation and social services. They are also milestones along our journey toward becoming a world-class business school and toward a brighter future.</p>
        <p>In October 2013, the construction of our School’s Zhengli Campus was launched and expected to be completed for inauguration in 2016. Our brand-new campus will be an open campus fully integrated with neighboring communities, the first of its kind in China or even around the world. From this new campus, we will further realize our dedication to breaking down the boundaries among academia, businesses and society and sharing our high-quality research results and outstanding talent freely and openly with others.</p>
        <p>After many years of continuous exploration and improvement, our School has been moving step by step on its way toward becoming one of the forerunners in this new era full of opportunities and challenges. Our growth could not have been made possible without assistance and guidance from supportive friends who are elite members in different walks of life. A case in point would be our first International Advisory Board (IAB) officially established in 2013. The IAB is composed of totally 27 members from the academic, political and business sectors with Mr. Lanqing LI, a former member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee and former Vice Premier of the State Council, serving as its Honorary Chairperson, and Ms. Zhili CHEN, former Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, serving as its Chairperson. It is not only a world-class, top-notched think tank abut also a pivotal connection between our School and the world. With its abundant global resources and intellectual insights, the IAB will provide strong support for our School’s further development.</p>
