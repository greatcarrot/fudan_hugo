        <p><strong>Testimonial:</strong> BI-Fudan MBA program is a prestigious milestone to me with a fruitful and pleasant journey.</p>
        <p>Even till now, I still remember the very first day when we were enrolled in this program two years ago. It was claimed that we would become the future business leader possessing both global view and local savvy, which means the best half of both sides. Today, I would like to say that I hold an even stronger faith in it. Thank you, BI-Fudan MBA program.</p>
        <p>First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the professors in this program. You never give us a ready-made solution. Instead, you aim to develop us into true business leaders in a real world without clinging to old clichés. We have been exposed to the latest discovery and best practice with a huge spectrum of industries and functions, which braces ourselves for the future challenge and further development.</p>
        <p>Second, I have to admit that there has been a lot of fun during the past two years. It still feels so good to recall the way we were debating over, the joke we were laughing at and the happiness we were sharing. It is such a unique experience to have the chance to exchange both professional ideas and personal interests with talents with all kinds of backgrounds. Thank you, my dear fellow classmates.</p>
        <p>All in all, it has been a truly wonderful journey. This program has improved our competence, widened our vision and boosted our confidence. Finally, I am happy to say: “YES, WE MADE IT.”</p>
