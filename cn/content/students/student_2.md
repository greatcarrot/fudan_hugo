        <p><strong>Testimonial:</strong> The program has been insightful, and more importantly, very stimulating to my thought process.</p>
        <p>I must say that it has been a terrific experience over the last 2 years at Fudan. First of all, my sincere thanks to all the excellent professors who have been really dedicated to make this a world class program, and a great help to make learning a fun process. Secondly, thanks for the well-designed program schedule which allows me to work, learn and still give a little bit of time for reflections between modules. The program has been insightful, and more importantly, very stimulating to my thought process.</p>
        <p>Next, a huge thank-you to my fellow classmates. I recalled Prof. Xu mentioned on day one that he expected a lot of learning to come from classmates, and I think that cannot be more truth to that statement. Being “relative young” in the class, I have benefited from the experiences of our classmates who come from diverse backgrounds and industries. My fellow classmates have also been the ones of the most energetic group and fun people to work with, and I must say that my learning from the program cannot be a complete experience without their interactions. The 2 years has passed so very quickly, and I will really miss the time I interacted with the class; leaving one longing for more.</p>
        <p>Last but not the least, I am very proud to be a student of BI-Fudan MBA Program, and you should be too. Cheers.</p>
