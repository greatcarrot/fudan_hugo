    <p>Oslo was showing off with clear sky and its 20 degrees when BI-Fudan MBA Class 19 and 20 went there for graduation in the beginning of May, 2015. After two tough years, balancing work, studies and family life, the students were finally ready to dress up in gowns and caps and become Masters of Business Administration. Associate Dean of the BI-Fudan MBA program, Professor Jan Ketil Arnulf, said the students had now been given a new title - Teachers, and encourage the graduates to share their knowledge and experience gained from the MBA to their colleagues. He added “Not all can claim themselves with the title Master of Business Administration such as you, therefore, use your knowledge and experience to help others succeed.”</p>
    <p>May 8, the graduation day started with a tour around Oslo visiting Akershus Festning, Vigelandsparken and Holmenkollen, three beloved spots by Oslo’s many tourists. The last one, Holmenkollen, a skijump arena, is one of the city’s most visited landmarks and symbolizes the country’s fascination for winter sports.</p>
    <p>After the tour, the students headed for BI Norwegian Business School’s campus for the graduation ceremony. Accompanied with traditional Norwegian music, the graduates were one by one called up to receive the diploma from the President of BI, Inge Jan Henjesand. The President encouraged the students to take part in the Join&Share organization to continue to learn, share experiences, and find common ground for continuous personal development. He also underlined what he has done many times before, that the collaboration with School of Management, Fudan University is strategically important for the business school and truly appreciate the friendship that has lasted for almost 20 years.</p>

    <p>Grefsenkollen Restaurant was carefully chosen for the graduation dinner. Its beautiful location on the top of a hill and a view over the city brings a special atmosphere to the celebration. Traditional Norwegian food was served, and the tones from Peer Gynt, as Norwegian play, entertained the newly graduates. Lise Hammergren, Executive Vice President of BI welcomed the students to the dinner, and Head of Alumni Barbro Kolbjørnsrud said that wherever you go, there will always be a BI alumni close by, “we will support you wherever you are” she added in her speech.</p>
    <p>The day ended with a performance from some Norwegian dancers, dancing traditional folk dance. They invited the graduates to join in and learn a few steps of the traditional national dance – which, we must all agree, was an enjoyable sight.</p>
